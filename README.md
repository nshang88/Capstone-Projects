# Capstone-Projects
Chose daily mean temperature data of 20 cities of 20 years (1995-2014) both in US and around the world to investigate the climate change.
Used the data visualization to see the different climate patterns of cities in different areas.
Utilized the hypothesis method to prove there was a significant mean temperature increase from 1995-1999 period to 2010-2014 period.
Applied the machine learning method to the prediction of temperatures in the future.
